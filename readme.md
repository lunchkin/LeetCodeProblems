### Leet Code Problems
- This repo is dedicated to supplying an archive for my solutions to the problems. I generally use Python when solving them, but that doesn't mean that I won't switch it up.

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration
- This exists just to supply an easy archive of my solutions to the LeetCode problems. I can't promise that I'll get all of them done, but the ones I do, I will at least put my solutions in here.

### Getting Started
- Clone the repo or copy a file
- You should just be able to go to the specific LeetCode problem and copy / paste the code into it
- There might be some exceptions to the line above, if I decide to add my own input for local testing / optimization. If that's the case, I will try to say so in the comments on the file

### TODO
- More LeetCode problems?
- Organize this project differently...? ... Maybe...

### License
- No license here, it's a pretty basic project. Steal away!
